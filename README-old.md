**Spearmint** has two main goals;

  1. provide a flexible engine for creating new games and mods.
  2. support features from (and running) various id Tech 3-based games.

Some of the major Spearmint features are:

  * Four player splitscreen
  * Moved a lot of code from server and client to Game and CGame VMs;
    * including console, chat input overlay, `usercmd_t` creation, and a lot of bot AI code.
  * Allow games to modify `entityState_t` and `playerState_t` without changing the engine.
  * Extended API for Game and CGame/UI, includes some of the features from;
    * RTCW, WolfET, Tremulous, Turtle Arena, and World of Padman
  * Merged UI VM into CGame VM, easier to modify as a whole / more flexible.
  * Additional shader keywords.

Some of the major ioquake3 features currently implemented are:

  * SDL backend
  * OpenAL sound API support (multiple speaker support and better sound
    quality)
  * Full x86_64 support on Linux
  * VoIP support, both in-game and external support through Mumble.
  * MinGW compilation support on Windows and cross compilation support on Linux
  * AVI video capture of demos
  * Much improved console autocompletion
  * Persistent console history
  * Colorized terminal output
  * Optional Ogg Vorbis support
  * Much improved QVM tools
  * Support for various esoteric operating systems
  * cl_guid support
  * HTTP/FTP download redirection (using cURL)
  * Multiuser support on Windows systems (user specific game data
    is stored in "%APPDATA%\Spearmint")
  * PNG support
  * Many, many bug fixes

The map editor and associated compiling tools are not included. We suggest you
use a modern copy from http://icculus.org/gtkradiant/.

The original id software readme that accompanied the Q3 source release has been
renamed to id-readme.txt so as to prevent confusion. Please refer to the
web-site for updated status.

# Game Code

The Quake 3 game, cgame, and ui code and QVM compiler are not included. If you wish to play Quake 3, you'll need to get
and build https://github.com/zturtleman/mint-arena/ too.

# Engine Compilation and installation

For *nix
  1. Change to the directory containing this readme.
  2. Run 'make'.

For Windows
  1. Install mingw-w64
  2. Change to the directory containing this readme.
  3. Run 'make'.

For Mac OS X, building a Universal Binary
  1. Install MacOSX SDK packages from XCode.  For maximum compatibility,
     install MacOSX10.4u.sdk and MacOSX10.3.9.sdk, and MacOSX10.2.8.sdk.
  2. Change to the directory containing this README file.
  3. Run './make-macosx-ub.sh'
  4. Copy the resulting ioquake3.app in /build/release-darwin-ub to your
     /Applications/ioquake3 folder.

Installation, for *nix
  1. Set the COPYDIR variable in the shell to be where you installed Quake 3
     to. By default it will be /usr/local/games/quake3 if you haven't set it.
     This is the path as used by the original Linux Q3 installer and subsequent
     point releases.
  2. Run 'make copyfiles'.

It is also possible to cross compile for Windows under *nix using MinGW. Your
distribution may have mingw32 packages available. On debian/Ubuntu, you need to
install 'mingw-w64'. Thereafter cross compiling is simply a case running
'PLATFORM=mingw32 ARCH=x86 make' in place of 'make'. ARCH may also be set to
x86_64.

The following variables may be set, either on the command line or in
Makefile.local:

                         the default for USE_INTERNAL_SPEEX etc.
                         and USE_LOCAL_HEADERS
  USE_INTERNAL_SPEEX   - build internal speex library instead of dynamically
                         linking against system libspeex

# README for Users

## Using shared libraries instead of qvm

To force Spearmint to use shared libraries instead of qvms run it with the following
parameters: `+set sv_pure 0 +set vm_cgame 0 +set vm_game 0`

## Using Demo Data Files

Copy demoq3/pak0.pk3 from the demo installer to your baseq3 directory. The
qvm files in this pak0.pk3 will not work, so you have to use the native
shared libraries or qvms from this project. To use the new qvms, they must be
put into a pk3 file. A pk3 file is just a zip file, so any compression tool
that can create such files will work. The shared libraries should already be
in the correct place. Use the instructions above to use them.

Please bear in mind that you will not be able to play online using the demo
data, nor is it something that we like to spend much time maintaining or
supporting.

## Help! Ioquake3 won't give me an fps of X anymore when setting com_maxfps!

Ioquake3 now uses the select() system call to wait for the rendering of the
next frame when com_maxfps was hit. This will improve your CPU load
considerably in these cases. However, not all systems may support a
granularity for its timing functions that is required to perform this waiting
correctly. For instance, ioquake3 tells select() to wait 2 milliseconds, but
really it can only wait for a multiple of 5ms, i.e. 5, 10, 15, 20... ms.
In this case you can always revert back to the old behaviour by setting the
cvar com_busyWait to 1.

## Using HTTP/FTP Download Support (Server)

You can enable redirected downloads on your server even if it's not
an ioquake3 server.  You simply need to use the 'sets' command to put
the sv_dlURL cvar into your SERVERINFO string and ensure sv_allowDownloads
is set to 1

sv_dlURL is the base of the URL that contains your custom .pk3 files
the client will append both fs_game and the filename to the end of
this value.  For example, if you have sv_dlURL set to
`"http://ioquake3.org"`, fs_game is `"baseq3"`, and the client is
missing `"test.pk3"`, it will attempt to download from the URL
`"http://ioquake3.org/baseq3/test.pk3"`

sv_allowDownload's value is now a bitmask made up of the following
flags:

  * 1 - ENABLE
  * 4 - do not use UDP downloads
  * 8 - do not ask the client to disconnect when using HTTP/FTP

Server operators who are concerned about potential "leeching" from their
HTTP servers from other ioquake3 servers can make use of the HTTP_REFERER
that ioquake3 sets which is `"ioQ3://{SERVER_IP}:{SERVER_PORT}"`.  For,
example, Apache's mod_rewrite can restrict access based on HTTP_REFERER.

On a sidenote, downloading via UDP has been improved and yields higher data
rates now. You can configure the maximum bandwidth for UDP downloads via the
cvar sv_dlRate. Due to system-specific limits the download rate is capped
at about 1 Mbyte/s per client, so curl downloading may still be faster.

## Using HTTP/FTP Download Support (Client)

Simply setting cl_allowDownload to 1 will enable HTTP/FTP downloads
assuming ioquake3 was compiled with USE_CURL=1 (the default).
like sv_allowDownload, cl_allowDownload also uses a bitmask value
supporting the following flags:

  * 1 - ENABLE
  * 2 - do not use HTTP/FTP downloads
  * 4 - do not use UDP downloads

When ioquake3 is built with USE_CURL_DLOPEN=1 (default on some platforms),
it will use the value of the cvar cl_cURLLib as the filename of the cURL
library to dynamically load.

## Multiuser Support on Windows systems
On Windows, all user specific files such as autogenerated configuration,
demos, videos, screenshots, and autodownloaded pk3s are now saved in a
directory specific to the user who is running ioquake3.

On NT-based such as Windows XP, this is usually a directory named:

    C:\Documents and Settings\%USERNAME%\Application Data\Spearmint\

Windows 95, Windows 98, and Windows ME will use a directory like:

    C:\Windows\Application Data\Spearmint

in single-user mode, or:

    C:\Windows\Profiles\%USERNAME%\Application Data\Spearmint

if multiple logins have been enabled.

In order to access this directory more easily, the installer may create a
Shortcut which has its target set to:

    %APPDATA%\Spearmint\

This Shortcut would work for all users on the system regardless of the
locale settings.  Unfortunately, this environment variable is only
present on Windows NT based systems.

You can revert to the old single-user behaviour by setting the fs_homepath
cvar to the directory where Spearmint is installed.  For example:

    spearmint.exe +set fs_homepath "c:\spearmint"

Note that this cvar MUST be set as a command line parameter.

## SDL Keyboard Differences

ioquake3 clients have different keyboard behaviour compared to the original
Quake3 clients.

  * SDL > 1.2.9 does not support disabling dead key recognition. In order to
      send dead key characters (e.g. ~, ', `, and ^), you must key a Space (or
      sometimes the same character again) after the character to send it on
      many international keyboard layouts.

  * The SDL client supports many more keys than the original Quake3 client.
      For example the keys: "Windows", "SysReq", "ScrollLock", and "Break".
      For non-US keyboards, all of the so called "World" keys are now supported
      as well as F13, F14, F15, and the country-specific mode/meta keys.

On many international layouts the default console toggle keys are also dead
keys, meaning that dropping the console potentially results in
unintentionally initiating the keying of a dead key. Furthermore SDL 1.2's
dead key support is broken by design and Q3 doesn't support non-ASCII text
entry, so the chances are you won't get the correct character anyway.

If you use such a keyboard layout, you can set the cvar cl_consoleKeys. This
is a space delimited list of key names that will toggle the console. The key
names are the usual Q3 names e.g. "~", "`", "c", "BACKSPACE", "PAUSE",
"WINDOWS" etc. It's also possible to use ASCII characters, by hexadecimal
number. Some example values for cl_consoleKeys:

    "~ ` 0x7e 0x60"           Toggle on ~ or ` (the default)
    "WINDOWS"                 Toggle on the Windows key
    "c"                       Toggle on the c key
    "0x43"                    Toggle on the C character (Shift-c)
    "PAUSE F1 PGUP"           Toggle on the Pause, F1 or Page Up keys

Note that when you elect a set of console keys or characters, they cannot
then be used for binding, nor will they generate characters when entering
text. Also, in addition to the nominated console keys, Shift-ESC is hard
coded to always toggle the console.

## QuakeLive mouse acceleration
(patch and this text written by TTimo from id)

I've been using an experimental mouse acceleration code for a while, and
decided to make it available to everyone. Don't be too worried if you don't
understand the explanations below, this is mostly intended for advanced
players:
To enable it, set cl_mouseAccelStyle 1 (0 is the default/legacy behavior)

New style is controlled with 3 cvars:

sensitivity
cl_mouseAccel
cl_mouseAccelOffset

The old code (cl_mouseAccelStyle 0) can be difficult to calibrate because if
you have a base sensitivity setup, as soon as you set a non zero acceleration
your base sensitivity at low speeds will change as well. The other problem
with style 0 is that you are stuck on a square (power of two) acceleration
curve.

The new code tries to solve both problems:

Once you setup your sensitivity to feel comfortable and accurate enough for
low mouse deltas with no acceleration (cl_mouseAccel 0), you can start
increasing cl_mouseAccel and tweaking cl_mouseAccelOffset to get the
amplification you want for high deltas with little effect on low mouse deltas.

cl_mouseAccel is a power value. Should be >= 1, 2 will be the same power curve
as style 0. The higher the value, the faster the amplification grows with the
mouse delta.

cl_mouseAccelOffset sets how much base mouse delta will be doubled by
acceleration. The closer to zero you bring it, the more acceleration will
happen at low speeds. This is also very useful if you are changing to a new
mouse with higher dpi, if you go from 500 to 1000 dpi, you can divide your
cl_mouseAccelOffset by two to keep the same overall 'feel' (you will likely
gain in precision when you do that, but that is not related to mouse
acceleration).

Mouse acceleration is tricky to configure, and when you do you'll have to
re-learn your aiming. But you will find that it's very much forth it in the
long run.

If you try the new acceleration code and start using it, I'd be very
interested by your feedback.


# README for Developers

## pk3dir

Spearmint has a useful new feature for mappers. Paths in a game directory with
the extension ".pk3dir" are treated like pk3 files. This means you can keep
all files specific to your map in one directory tree and easily zip this
folder for distribution.

## Creating standalone games

Have you finished the daunting task of removing all dependencies on the Q3
game data? You probably now want to give your users the opportunity to play
the game without owning a copy of Q3.

However, before you start compiling your own version of Spearmint, you have to
ask yourself: Have we changed or will we need to change anything of importance
in the engine? If your answer to this question is "no", you should probably
just use Spearmint.

If you really changed parts that would make vanilla Spearmint incompatible with
your mod, we have included another way to conveniently build a stand-alone
binary. Just run make. Don't forget to edit the PRODUCT_NAME and subsequent
 #defines in qcommon/q_shared.h with information appropriate for your project.

## Standalone game licensing

While a lot of work has been put into Spearmint that you can benefit from free
of charge, it does not mean that you have no obligations to fulfill. Please be
aware that as soon as you start distributing your game with an engine based on
our sources we expect you to fully comply with the requirements as stated in
the GPL. That includes making sources and modifications you made to the
Spearmint engine as well as the game-code used to compile the .qvm files for
the game logic freely available to everyone. Furthermore, note that the "QIIIA
Game Source License" prohibits distribution of mods that are intended to
operate on a version of Q3 not sanctioned by id software:

    "with this Agreement, ID grants to you the non-exclusive and limited right
    to distribute copies of the Software ... for operation only with the full
    version of the software game QUAKE III ARENA"

This means that if you're creating a standalone game, you cannot use said
license on any portion of the product. As the only other license this code has
been released under is the GPL, this is the only option.

This does NOT mean that you cannot market this game commercially. The GPL does
not prohibit commercial exploitation and all assets (e.g. textures, sounds,
maps) created by yourself are your property and can be sold like every other
game you find in stores.

## cl_guid Support

cl_guid is a cvar which is part of the client's USERINFO string.  Its value
is a 32 character string made up of [a-f] and [0-9] characters.  This
value is pseudo-unique for every player.  Id's Quake 3 Arena client also
sets cl_guid, but only if Punkbuster is enabled on the client.

If cl_guidServerUniq is non-zero (the default), then this value is also
pseudo-unique for each server a client connects to (based on IP:PORT of
the server).

The purpose of cl_guid is to add an identifier for each player on
a server.  This value can be reset by the client at any time so it's not
useful for blocking access.  However, it can have at least two uses in
your mod's game code:

  1. improve logging to allow statistical tools to index players by more
       than just name
  2. granting some weak admin rights to players without requiring passwords

## PNG support

ioquake3 supports the use of PNG (Portable Network Graphic) images as
textures. It should be noted that the use of such images in a map will
result in missing placeholder textures where the map is used with the id
Quake 3 client or earlier versions of ioquake3.

Recent versions of GtkRadiant and q3map2 support PNG images without
modification. However GtkRadiant is not aware that PNG textures are supported
by ioquake3. To change this behaviour open the file 'q3.game' in the 'games'
directory of the GtkRadiant base directory with an editor and change the
line:

    texturetypes="tga jpg"

to

    texturetypes="tga jpg png"

Restart GtkRadiant and PNG textures are now available.

## Building with MinGW for pre Windows XP

IPv6 support requires a header named "wspiapi.h" to abstract away from
differences in earlier versions of Windows' IPv6 stack. There is no MinGW
equivalent of this header and the Microsoft version is obviously not
redistributable, so in its absence we're forced to require Windows XP.
However if this header is acquired separately and placed in the qcommon/
directory, this restriction is lifted.


# Contributing
